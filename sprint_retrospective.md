# Sprint Review

## 1. Sprint Overview
**Sprint Goal:**  
Implement a robust password strength checker using Test-Driven Development (TDD), establishing a clear process for coding, testing, and documentation.

**Key Deliverables:**  
- Developed the `password_strength` function to validate password criteria.  
- Wrote and executed unit tests to ensure functionality.  
- Set up a Git repository with proper branch usage and commit history.  
- Documented the sprint progress using Trello (or GitHub Projects) and supporting Markdown files.

---

## 2. What Went Well
- The TDD approach helped in catching errors early and ensured that tests covered essential functionality.  
- The implementation of the `password_strength` function was smooth, and the unit tests passed reliably.  
- Regular commits and proper Git usage maintained code version control efficiently.  
- Clear documentation of tasks through Trello and Markdown files kept the sprint organized.

---

## 3. What Didn’t Go Well
- Some edge cases (particularly with unusual symbols and non-standard inputs) were not initially considered, requiring additional fixes.  
- The initial setup of the project structure and integration of tools (Trello, Git, Markdown) took longer than estimated.

---

## 4. What We Learned
- Improved understanding of TDD and its benefits, particularly its role in early error detection.  
- Enhanced skills in writing unit tests that cover both typical and edge cases.  
- Learned the importance of a well-organized project structure and consistent commit messages for effective version control.

## 5. Action Items for Next Sprint
 Expand unit tests to cover more edge scenarios (e.g., special symbols, unicode, etc.) 
 
 Streamline the initial setup process by creating a reusable project template 
 
 Adopt a more advanced branching strategy and refine commit messages
